Capibara Distributed Url Cloaking Kit : capdns.pl
.Sh DESCRIPTION

The capdns.pl script is the DNS server part of the cduck system. Please take note that this DNS server
is in no way comparable to full-fledged DNS servers like bind, its basic function is the 'that's me'
function needed for the redundancy of the http cloaking service.

capdns has got the possibility to deviate from the standard that's me response for some additional RR's,
but this ability is mostly focussed on small amounts (tens to hundreds) records for the most needed
types of RR's. capdns currently supports A,NS,SOA, MX and very limited PTR requests. A,NS and MX records 
are configurable trough the zones.txt file (you should not edit this file directly, it is generated by
capcron.pl, only edit the file directly if you want to run capdns separate from a cduck system.
