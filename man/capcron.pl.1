.Sh DESCRIPTION

capcron.pl is the script that cduck uses from the cron of the capfetch
user in order to keep synchronized with the master zone and map file resources.

It uses the /usr/local/capibara/cduck/etc/cduck.conf file in order to find out where
to find the appropriate resources. In the /usr/local/capibara/cduck/icsh/ dir it will
try to maintain a cache for all the resources in order to be able to create 
consistent map and zone files from the base resources if at some point in time 
parts of the resources are not available. 

capcron.pl will create three files in the /usr/local/capibara/cduck/etc/db/ directory 
that are used by the other components of cduck.

\fBdb_current\fR

This Berkeley db file will be generated by capcron.pl and will contain the verified
map files that capcron.pl fetched.

\fBzoneindex.txt\fR  

This text file will be generated by capcron.pl and will contain the names of the zones
to be served by the cduck system.

\fBzones.txt\fR

This text file will  be generated by capcron.pl and will contain the combination of zone 
files with fully qualified RR names.
