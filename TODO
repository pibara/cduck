Todo for 1.0.0 release.
* 3 months of final beta status and possible bug-fix releases 
* The 1.0.0 release

After the 0.9.7 release, the cvs tree will be branced. The stable tree 
will only be extended with bug-fixes in order to reach a stable 1.0 
release. Work on the new beta tree (1.1.x) will include:

* Create SIPESDL (sipes.sourceforge.net) component integration within tids.
  This will enable automated global pull the plug actions in case of
  serious bugs in cduck.
* Implementation of a DNSSec subset.
* Implementation of mapping request toolkit for use in setting
  up a 'give away unused subdomains' cgi interface in the spirit
  of the old capibara service.
* Look at portability to the NetBSD and OpenBSD platform.
* IPv6 support
