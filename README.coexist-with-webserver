cduck can coexist with an other web server on the same machine.
To accomplish this you should follow the normal procedures for 
installation except for the rc.d/cduck script. You should use the
rc.d/cducknohttp rc script instead. This script will not start up 
the httpd included with cduck.

On your web-server you will now need to install either the cgi 
script misc/index.cgi as the default index, or the php 
script misc/index.php.

Please consult your server software documentation for instructions.
You will also want to change the $rp variable in the index.cgi 
or index.php script to your administrators e-mail address. 
Please take care in the .cgi to escape the '@' as '\@'.

At this point the .cgi is more complete than the .php, for this reason
you should probably first try the .cgi and if this fails and you
are unable to reconfigure your web-server correctly you should try to
fall back on the .php script.
