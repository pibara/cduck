User state info in sockets opened as root:
  The cduck components need to start as root in order to be able to bind to the required
  privileged ports. Although iptables (on Linux) and ipfw (on FreeBSD) both are able to
  detect and stop traffic that any cduck process might generate on newly created sockets
  that were not there when the process changed its uid, the privileged port sockets
  are not detected or stopped by the uses specific tables or ipfw lines.
  This problem will limit the extend of the containment measures as provided by the
  trivial intrusion detection system that comes with cduck.
  It appears that this is an intrinsic problem that exist with user based fire-walling and
  privileged ports. Any help in finding a solution for this problem is very welcome.
